## Basic usage

```kotlin
expectedDataArray = listOf(ChartEntry(1f, 1f), ChartEntry(2f, 2f), ChartEntry(3f, 3f)
actualDataArray = listOf(ChartEntry(1f, 1f), ChartEntry(2f, 2f))
forecastedDataArray = listOf(ChartEntry(2f, 2f), ChartEntry(3f, 3f))

forecastChartComponent{
    size(MATCH, 350)
    expectedLine(expectedDataArray, "Expected", Color.BLUE)
    actualLine(actualDataArray, "Actual", Color.GREEN)
    forecastedLine(forecastedDataArray, "Forecasted", Color.GRAY)
    unit("mÂ³")
}

Initialize the timezone information in your `Application.onCreate()` method, for handle with date-time:
```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    AndroidThreeTen.init(this)
}
```
